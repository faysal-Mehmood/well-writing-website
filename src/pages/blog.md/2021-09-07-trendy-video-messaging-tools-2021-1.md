  ### Video Messaging trend


  Although real time conferencing is essential while working in distant locations, spending too much time on face-to-face online meeting actually results in lower productivity and higher fatigue. Many collaborators are now seeking for more efficient way to communicate with their remote coworkers, and VIDEO MESSAGING is recently gaining popularity. Today, I want to share 5 unique video messaging tools that can significantly save your time previously wasted on meetings and emails.


  1. [Loom](https://www.loom.com/): Top video messaging tool for content creation

  2. [Yac](https://www.yac.com/): Slack for Video Messaging

  3. [Pingpong](https://www.getpingpong.com/): Video messaging tool for remote team

  4. [Bonjoro](https://www.bonjoro.com/): Video messaging tool for customer relationship

  ### 1. [Loom](https://www.loom.com/): Top video messaging tool for content creation

  Loom is one of the most dominant video messaging tools in the market with as many as 12 million active users from 190 countries throughout the world. You can simply record your computer screen along with a video of yourself using Loom. After the recording is over, you are automatically redirected to their dashboard, where you can edit, comment, and freely communicate with your collaborators about the video. Although these are pretty simple features that many other companies provide, their perfect user experience is a secret behind their success.

  Loom provides over 20 integrations including Sack, Notion, Jira, Trello, Github, and Gmail, allowing different type of users to strengthen their workflow without a need to change the tools they have been using for a long time. Furthermore, cross-platform compatibility of Loom allows any potential customers to easily access the service by providing their app in 5 different platforms which include Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and Google Chrome Extension.


  After trying it out for past couple of weeks, I am personally using Loom to create asynchronous marketing campaigns and sales presentations.


  Although they also provide advanced features such as video drawing tools, custom branding option, salesforce integration, and more, these functions are only available to the paid business plan subscribers for $12+/month.


  **Overview**


  **Pros:** Over 20 Integrations, Cross-Platform, Outstanding UI/UX, No learning curve


  **Cons:** Dashboard only opened through web, Expensive, Too many paid features


  ### 2. [Yac](https://www.yac.com/): Slack for Video Messaging

  Yac is asynchronous voice and video messenger for businesses and organizations. Their mission is to decrease times wasted on unnecessary meetings and to solely focus on productivity. In addition to traditional video and audio recording, Yac also supports screen recording feature, just like Loom. One of the biggest advantages of Yac is that creating an audio or a video message is as simple as writing a text using this app. You can simply click 'Start Recording' button after choosing a channel to get started. By using 'Record to a shareable link' feature, you can also send your message, of which can be downloaded, to any individual whether they have a Yac account or not. Furthermore, messages are automatically transcribed in Yac so that the recipient who prefers a text can read the message instead of listening to long audio file. What I liked the most yac was a transcription service which makes it so much easier to search for the old messages just by typing couple keywords.

  Although Yac does not provide as many integrations as Loom, they currently support Slack and Zapier, assisting the users to connect with many other popular apps. It personally took me some time to explore and get used to all the features they provide however, I felt comfortable after a while since the UI of the app resembled that of Slack.


  **Overview**


  **Pros:** Easy to send Audio Message, Auto-Transcription, Familiar UI, Cross-Platform


  **Cons:** Some learning curve


  ### 3. [Pingpong](https://www.getpingpong.com/): Video messaging tool for remote team


  ![](https://strum-app.netlify.app/img/ping1.png)


  Pingpong is a startup that participated in Y-combinator batch in Winter 2021. Just like Yac, it is an async voice and video messenger for remote teams. However, while my first impression towards Yac was a voice first messenger that provides video features, Ping Pong was just the other way around. When you open the application, first thing you'll see is a list of video messages created, in big rectangular thumbnails. It is interesting to see how each video can be used as a workspace(thread) where you can simply reply or comment using the same recording features.
