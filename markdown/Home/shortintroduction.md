  ABOUT WELL-WRITTEN
button heading medium:
  WELL-WRITTEN is the brainchild of Jayme Wium, a seasoned
  writer, ghostwriter, proofreader, and editor. Jayme started her writing
  journey when she was just a kid in junior school and cites Enid Blyton as her
  inspiration. The Magic Faraway Tree was the first book that made Jayme realize
  the power of words, and ever since, her passion for bringing words to life has
  only grown from strength to strength.

  The WELL-WRITTEN team writes blogs and articles, product
  descriptions, website content, kids books, books for all ages, booklets, lead
  magnets, and proofreading and editing content and documents written in English
  by non-native speakers. But WELL-WRITTEN isn't all about Jayme. It's about the
  people she has recruited and trained to help make average or mediocre content
  projects wow-worthy. These are the people who make WELL-WRITTEN a possibility.
  This very team tackles projects alongside Jayme and assists in the many
  training and education programs the company is currently working on and
  publishing.
