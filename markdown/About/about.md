  Before you sign up as a client, you might wonder who the heck we are and why
  you should trust WELL-WRITTEN with your content writing. Well, here's the
  scoop (and you can check us out below too).


  WELL-WRITTEN is the brainchild of Jayme Wium, a seasoned writer, ghostwriter, proofreader, and editor. Jayme started her writing journey when she was just a kid in junior school and cites Enid Blyton as her inspiration. The Magic Faraway Tree was the first book that made Jayme realize the power of words, and ever since, her passion for bringing words to life has only grown from strength to strength.


  Now, school days are long gone, and with bills to pay, Jayme works as a full-time professional writer serving her own clients, thus the birth of WELL-WRITTEN and the bringing together of a team of not just writers but exceptional writers. Having ghostwritten hundreds of books and been the think tank and author of thousands of articles since her very first paid content piece in 2009, Jayme is more than skilled, experienced, and suited to managing the handling of your content.


  The WELL-WRITTEN team writes blogs and articles, product descriptions, website content, kids books, books for all ages, booklets, lead magnets, and proofreading and editing content and documents written in English by non-native speakers. But WELL-WRITTEN isn't all about Jayme. It's about the people she has recruited and trained to help make average or mediocre content projects wow-worthy. These are the people who make WELL-WRITTEN a possibility. This very team tackles projects alongside Jayme and assists in the many training and education programs the company is currently working on and publishing.


  So if you are an aspiring writer, stay-at-home-mum, or someone with a passion for the written word who wants to escape the humdrum of office life, we have one thing to say to you: it is possible. You merely need the right skills development, training, and support. You can get all of these things at WELL-WRITTEN.


  The WELL-WRITTEN team doesn't want to keep the content market all to themselves. Instead, the team aspires to become a go-to place for writers and would-be writers to come and gather all the skills they need to get up and running as freelance writers. Not just writers, mind you, but writers with exceptional skills and the know-how to get ahead in the industry.


  As a client ordering writing services, there's no reason to fear you will end up with substandard content. We never pass on work to writers who aren't on our team, and our dedicated writers have been thoroughly vetted and working with us for years. If that's not enough, rest assured that all articles are sussed out by Jayme and her trusty Editors, Lyn and Jadel, to ensure that you receive nothing but the best when you get your content back. You don't know Lyn or Jadel, but just so you know, they have eagle eyes for errors, sloppy sentences, and content that needs to be poo-pooed.


  As a team, we're also allergic to poor-quality copy and plagiarism, so you never have to worry about any of that. If you're ready to experience excellent service, affordable rates, and killer content, get in touch with us or place an order request with us today.
